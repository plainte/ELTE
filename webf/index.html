							<h2>Season 3</h2>
							<p>
								In December 2012, SK Telecom acquired the roster of Eat Sleep Game, with a roster consisting of Reapered, H0R0, MighTiLy, UandME, and StarLast.
								See the history of that team at SK Telecom T1 S (originally SK Telecom T1, then SK Telecom T1 #1).
								In February 2013, the organization created a new roster, which consisted of Faker, bengi, Piglet, PoohManDu, and Impact.
								See the history of that team at SK Telecom T1 K (originally SK Telecom T1 #2). On November 12, the sister teams were renamed from #1 and #2 to S and K, respectively.
								Though it was initially known as SK Telecom's secondary team, K outperformed S, winning the Season 3 World Championship.
								Upon their return to Korea, SKT T1 K became the only team to have a perfect season (not losing a single game) in Champions Winter 2013-2014.
							</p>

							<h3>Season 4</h3>
							<p>
								SK Telecom competed in LoL Masters 2014. The organization had a 6-0 set record in the round robin, with a 14-4 game record.
								In the playoffs, they were seeded directly into the finals but then lost 0-3 to Samsung, placing second overall. Although
								SKT T1 K won All-Star Paris 2014 with out losing a single game, both SKT teams failed to make Worlds at the end of the
								season.
							</p>

							<h3>Season 5</h3>
							<p>
								In November 2014, it was announced that Korean teams could no longer have two separate rosters, and SK Telecom T1's teams disbanded, reforming a single team simply called SK Telecom
								T1. As with all other OGN teams, they would have a 10-member roster. The team was invited to play in Champions Spring 2015. On December 2, a roster was announced for the preseason
								that
								included MaRin, Impact, Bengi, Easyhoon, Faker, Bang, Wolf, and Piccaboo. Of these players, Piccaboo was the only new addition; the other seven players had previously competed on
								either S or K
							</p>
							<p>
								SKT entered their first tournament of the 2015 Season at SBENU Champions Spring 2015. They placed second in the regular season so they had to face CJ Entus in the second round of
								playoffs and took the series 3-2. They went on to play the KOO Tigers where they took the series 3-0 without Faker or Bengi having to play. The win secured them a spot at the 2015
								Mid-Season Invitational where they won every game in groups. After a close 3-2 series against Fnatic, they moved on to face EDward Gaming in the finals where SKT was upset 3-2.
							</p>
							<p>
								They came back to Korea for SBENU Champions Summer 2015 where they went almost undefeated, only dropping a series to CJ Entus. Their first place finish in the regular season
								guaranteed
								them a spot at the 2015 Season World Championship due to having the most Championship Points. In the finals of the playoffs they beat KT Rolster 3-0 to take 1st place in playoffs and
								advance to the 2015 Season World Championship as the first seed from Korea.
							</p>
							<p>
								SKT was placed in a group at worlds alongside EDG, Bangkok Titans, and H2k Gaming. They went undefeated all the way to the finals, beating AHQ e-Sports Club and Origen in the
								playoffs
								along the way. They met the KOO Tigers in the finals and beat them 3-1 to give the organization its second World Championship.

							<h3>Season 6</h3>
							<p>
								In March, SK Telecom attended IEM Katowice despite being only the sixth-place LCK team at the time. They brought substitute jungler Blank in place of bengi and swept through the
								tournament, winning the title after only seven games. Returning to Korea, they began to use Blank as their full-time starting jungler and improved from a series record of 5-4 after
								week 7 to 12-6 after week 13, behind only the Tigers and KT Rolster in the standings. In the playoffs, they easily beat Jin Air and KT before facing the ROX Tigers for the second
								time
								in a spring finals. This time, instead of a 3-0 it was a 3-1, but SKT still won and were crowned LCK champions for the third consecutive time.
							</p>
							<p>
								Their first place finish in the spring season earned them a spot in the 2016 Mid-Season Invitational. Notably, SK Telecom T1 were the only team to return to 2016 MSI from 2015 MSI.
								As
								the reigning domestic champions of Korea, SK Telecom T1 came into the tournament as massive favorites to win. However, their group stage performances were very lackluster as they
								dropped games to China's Royal Never Give Up, NA's Counter Logic Gaming, and two games to the LMS Flash Wolves. They ended their group stage with a 6-4 record, seeding them into the
								bracket stage at fourth place. Matched up against Royal Never Give Up in the semifinals, SK Telecom started to regain their form, beating them 3-1. They then proceeded to beat
								Counter
								Logic Gaming 3-0 to win the event and give them the trophy that barely escaped them last year.
							</p>
							<p>
								At the 2016 Season World Championship, SK Telecom T1 were placed into Group B, along with LMS's Flash Wolves, NA's Cloud 9, and China's I May. The team proceeded to win five of the
								six
								games during the Group Stage, as they displayed a vast arsenal of team compositions and fielded both Bengi and Blank in the jungle position. They were drafted into the Quarterfinals
								against the Chinese Royal Never Give Up, the second place team of Group D. After beating RNG 3-1, they proceeded to the semifinals where they met the ROX Tigers. After a long and
								grueling five games, where ROX won two of them with a surprise Miss Fortune support, SKT won 3-2 in what host Dash called the greatest best of five at Worlds ever. They moved on to
								face Samsung Galaxy in the Grand Finals: after a long, hard-fought 3-2 series SKT became the first League of Legends team to win three World Championships and first repeat winners of
								the title of World Champions.

							<h3>Season 7</h3>
							<p>
								Duke and Bengi left the team before the season began and were replaced by ex-Immortals top laner Huni and ex-ROX jungler Peanut. In the Spring Split, they finished first in the
								regular
								season, then defeated KT Rolster 3-0 in the finals. At the Mid-Season Invitational, SKT finished first in the group stage, swept Flash Wolves in the semifinals, then beat G2 Esports
								3-1 in the finals, gaining an unoffical triple crown award (LCK Champions, Worlds Champions, and MSI Champions).
							</p>
							<p>
								However, the team began to falter in the LCK Summer Split 2017. SKT finished only fourth in the regular season before embarking on a surprising gauntlet run to the finals, including
								a
								reverse sweep of kt Rolster. Despite being massively favored to take the finals as well, the miracle ended there, and they were defeated by Longzhu Gaming 3-1, thought they would
								still
								qualify for the 2017 Season World Championship as Korea's second seed.
							</p>
							<p>
								SK Telecom T1 were placed into Group A along with ahq e-Sports Club, Cloud9, and EDward Gaming. They finished first in the group with a 5-1 record, although their one loss came
								against
								the unimpressive Ahq, and several of their other wins were comeback victories. In the quarterfinals, the faced off against Europe's Misfits Gaming, who were massive underdogs and had
								not even been expected to make it out of groups in the first place. After a perfect game 1, SK Telecom T1 surprisingly lost the next two games to the European team, pushing them to
								the
								brink of defeat, before recovering to take the series. They then beat the Chinese team Royal Never Give Up in another close 3-2 set in order to qualify for the finals. However, there
								they lost 3-0 to Samsung Galaxy - the first time SKT had lost a World Championship. Soon after the season's end, Peanut and Huni left the team. At the 2017 KeSPA Cup, SKT defeated
								Griffin 2-1 in the quarterfinals but were later eliminated by Longzhu Gaming 2-0.

							<h3>Season 8</h3>
							<p>
								SKT signed two new rookies for the top and jungle, Thal and Blossom respectively, and support Effort was also moved to the starting roster. In the Spring Split, SKT fared horribly
								for
								the first time, going in 1-5 into week 3 and landing in 9th place for the first time. Only when they put in Blossom as their starting jungler did SKT's fortunes begin to rise, but
								they
								clearly lacked their previous form and lost all their series to the top three teams. Their playoff spot was at risk when they were defeated by both KT Rolster and Kingzone DragonX
								2-0
								in several series but after beating MVP and Kongdoo Monster, SKT managed to secure a playoff spot as the 4th seed. In the playoffs, SKT redeemed themselves from the Worlds loss by
								beating KSV (the rebranded Samsung Galaxy) 2-1 in the wildcard match but were crushed by KT Rolster 3-1 in the "Telecom War" quarterfinals, ending their spring season and playoff
								run,
								as well as denying them qualification for the 2018 Mid-Season Invitational for the first time. Since SK Telecom T1 was part of the top four teams who participated in the playoffs,
								the
								team was invited to Rift Rivals 2018 but the LCK was defeated by the LPL in a close 3-2 series. In the Summer Season, SK Telecom T1 seemingly recovered but they performed very poorly
								and that the ended with an 8-10 record, denying them a playoff spot for the first time in their history. But since SK Telecom T1 had 30 championship points from Spring, they competed
								in the 2018 Korea Regional Finals but they were crushed by Gen G., the former KSV eSports in a close 3-2 set, ending their season and denying them qualification for the 2018 World
								Championship for the first time since 2014.
							</p>
							<p>
								Following the poor 2018 season, SKT began to rebuild their roster around Faker, along with subs Leo and Effort. Rumors began to circulate on who would be a part of the "superteam"
								and
								on November 22nd, the SKT Twitter officially announced the signing of Khan, Crazy, Clid, Haru, and Teddy. During the next two weeks superstar support Mata was also signed as well as
								coaches Fly and Zefa who worked with Jin Air and Afreeca, respectively, last season.
							</p>
							<p>
								Shortly after the announcement they already had to play in the 2018 LoL KeSPA Cup where they had to fight through the first two rounds due to their championship points ranking. These
								were despite little practice no problem for them as they easily swept past APK Prince and bbq's new roster. Their run then ended in quarterfinals against DAMWON Gaming who had the
								same
								core for the whole season going through challenger already.

							<h3>Season 9</h3>
							<p>
								After a few weeks of practice the roster managed to have a good start to LCK Spring Split 2019 and found itself tied for 2nd place after 5 weeks. The team continued to improve over
								the
								course of the split and only dropped one more series in regular season when they just fell short of becoming the first team to beat Griffin this split. In playoff semifinals against
								Kingzone they had 2 convincing blue side victories and a 45 minute comeback on red side to sweep the series 3-0 and fight Griffin for the title. This highly anticipated series became
								was very anticlimatic after SKT managed to outscale Griffin's surprising botlane picks before dominating the next two games for another clean sweep and their 7th LCK title. This also
								meant that they qualified for the Mid-Season Invitational.
							</p>
							<p>
								At MSI, the Korean champions went 1-1 for each of the first 3 days in the group stage with one loss against IG and two versus G2. SKT then went on to sweep the final two days 4-0
								being
								the only team to defeat Invictus Gaming in the group stage and moved on to face G2 Esports in the semifinals after iG picked Team Liquid as its opponent. SKT lost to G2 in the
								semifinals.
							</p>
							<p>
								For their final match of the regular season SKT managed to reverse sweep SANDBOX Gaming to finish the split 11-7 and qualify for the wildcard match with their last chance. For the
								wildcard match of playoffs they faced 5th place Afreeca and won 2-1 in a close series. In Round 2 waited Sandbox and after a close game 1 SKT dominated game 2 and stomped them in
								game
								3 for a quick clean sweep. Round 3 against DAMWON Gaming went pretty much exactly the same so they once again made it to finals against Griffin. With a dominant 3-1 SKT became the
								first team to win the playoffs after starting in wildcard match for their 8th LCK title. They will be representing LCK as the first seed at Worlds 2019.
							</p>
							<p>
								At Worlds they were drawn into group C with LEC 2nd seed Fnatic, LPL 2nd seed Royal Never Give Up and LCS 3rd seed Clutch Gaming. They finished 5-1 getting upset in week 2 by Fnatic
								and winning two extremely close games against RNG which earned them 1st place in the group. For quarterfinals they were drawn against LEC 3rd seed Splyce and showed again why they
								were
								seen as one of the favourites as they won the series clearly 3-1 against Splyce to face G2 Esports in semifinals. Despite leading for most of game 1 they found themselves on the
								losing
								side after Faker got picked off and they were swept in the following fight. After a clean game 2 victory they were once again outplayed in the deciding moments of games 3 and 4 and
								lost the series therefore deservedly 1-3 ending their season earlier than they had hoped.
